## Contribution Conventions

1. Start using functional components.

2. Start using module resolver.

    eg.
    ### bad practice
    ```
    import LanguageScreen from '../../languageScreen';
    ```
    ### good practice
    ```
    import LanguageScreen from '@/screens/profileScreen/LanguageScreen'
    ```
    ### Reason
    * Easy to debug the file.
    * Increase readability.

3. Don't use Inline styles.
4. Please take create of the variable names. A variable name should define the function work.
5. If you are using colors. Then please create a color object for your component.
* Please add the outside the component scope like styles object. Define this after the Imports.

e.g.
```
const colors = {
   colorName: 'colorCode'
}
```
### Reason
In the future, if we have to change the color so we don't need to find them. This makes easy to find and updates.
